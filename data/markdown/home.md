This is the official Lunchbox 🍱 Theme Generator. This useful tool helps in the fast creation of a theme that automatically adapts to dark and light color schemes and generates utility classes for every color in the palette.

Using the predefined Lunchbox color palette, one can choose three colors and the rest will be generated taking into account the correct accessibility practices.
